                As described in our "How to Contribute"[link] and "Code of Conduct"[link] sections,
                we welcome any community members to contribute through code improvements, blog posts
                or other opportunities. We fundamentally believe that the strength of the MPF comes
                through its community and the diverse skillsets, backgrounds, personalities and experiences.

            <p>
                The MPF Leadership Board is responsible for setting & maintaining the core mission
                of the MPF. The Leadership Board meets on the third Sunday of every month, to review
                high-level progress, discuss big-picture ideas and vote on future plans. Each team
                member receives one vote and decisions are made by simple majority. All decisions are
                clearly documented for future reference.
            </p>
            <p>
                Members of the MPF community who have shown significant investment in the project
                may be added to the MPF Leadership Board by a simple majority vote. There is no maximum
                limit to the number of Board Members, but there must always be at least 5 members at
                any given time. Board Members can choose to step down at any given time, but must
                give at least two months notice in order to allow for replacement members to be selected.
            </p>

                Project decisions are made through discussion with all members of the community.
                Discussion primarily takes place on the GitHub issue tracker and the MPF Discord
                channel, with a final decision being made by the Leadership Board via simple-majority vote.
